# kNN (cont.)

- The features and its associated label will be collected and visualized (through whatever medium).
- Sometimes there is *outlier* (data that is misleading/did not give the information that we want).
- Once the data had been visualized, we can plot the features that need to perdict into the visualized table.
- The *k* value will be the decisive factor to predict whether the data is *this* or *that*.
- Sometimes `k=1` and `k=3` might derived a different conclusion.

- Euclidean Distance
- D = sqrt((x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2)

- Scale is important for distance measurement.
> Scaling method
> - Standard Scaler
> - Min-Max Scaler
> - Mean Abs. Scaler

- kNN + regresion -> predict
- Regression: find a best line to fit into the graph
