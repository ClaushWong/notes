# Regression

- Statistic measure that attempts to determine the strength of the relationship between...
  - One dependent variable (Y)
  - Series of other changing variables (independent variables)
- In equation Y = f(X_1,X_2,...,X_*n*).
- Widely used for prediction and forecasting.

> Types of Regression
> - Simple (Linear) Regression
> - Multiple Regression

- Variables
| Independent | Inputs to a system and may take on different values freely. |
| Dependent | ... |

> Linear Regression
> - Simplest mathematical relationship between two variables x and y and is a linear relationship.

> Simple Linear Regression
> - Useful for finding relationship between two continuous variables.
> - Statistic relationship (/) 
> - Deterministic relationship (X)
> - Statistic relationshoip is not accurate in determining relationsip between 2 variables.
> - Core idea: Obtain a line that best fits the data.
>   - One for which total prediction error(data points) are as small as possible.
>   - Error is the distance between the point to the regression line.
